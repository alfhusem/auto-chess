# Auto Chess

This project is a work-in-progress game that I'm developing in Unity. 
The name "Auto Chess" is a placeholder name and describes the game's genre, which is inpired by games such as Teamfight Tactics 
and Hearthstone's Battlegrounds. The gameplay consists of automatic battles between units, where the player's input is purely buying and 
upgrading units: moving, targeting and attacking is controlled by the computer.
